This zip file contains the telephone set atomic model for a plain old
telephone system (POTS).  The telephone set files are as follows:

potsdefs.h - definitions used by POTS 
telephone.h - header file for the telephone atomic model
telephone.cpp - implementation file for the telephone atomic model

phone.bat - batch file to run the telephone set tests
phone.ma - model definition file for testing the telephone set
phone.ev - event file for testing the telephone set, tests are:
           - pick up, hang up
           - pick up, dial tone, hang up
           - pick up, dial tone, dial number, hear ringing tone, hang up
           - pick up, dial tone, dial number, hear ringing tone,
             connected, hang up
           - pick up, dial tone, dial number, hear ringing tone, connected,
             disconnected, hang up
           - pick up, dial tone, dial number, busy tone, hang up
           - pick up, dial tone, dial number, wrong number tone, hang up
           - pick up, dial tone, spurious ring signal (should get ignored),
             spurious pick up signal (should get ignored), dial number,
             spurious dial number (should get ignored), hear ringing tone,
             spurious busy signal (should get ignored), spurious wrong number
             tone (should get ignored), hang up
           - phone ring, pick up, connected, hang up
           - phone ring, pick up, connected, disconnected, hang up
           - combinaton of spurios signals mixed with meaningful signals
phone.log - log file from running the telephone set tests
phone.txt - explanation file (this file)

makefile - modified to compile the telephone set code
register.cpp - modified to register the Telephone atomic model
